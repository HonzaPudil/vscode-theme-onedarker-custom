# Atom One Darker

This is a vscode theme inspired by the [Atom One Dark UI theme](https://atom.io/themes/one-dark-ui) but with a higher contrast.

I will add more languages frequently. Currently only vanilla javascript is supported fully.

If you find any bugs or have any requests please file an issue.
